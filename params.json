Furthermore, an integrated activity logging interface allows real-time ground truth labeling by the use of Google Glass' touchpad. Therefore, this software can be used in the area of activity recognition using a machine learning approach.\r\n\r\n![Google Glass on a table](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/GoogleGlass.png)\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\n### Sensor Data Logging\r\nThis software is able to record motion, orientation, visual, acoustic, and beacon proximity sensor data on the Google Glass. Furthermore, a module that allows one to read out Google Glass' infrared eye proximity sensor is integrated. The eye proximity sensor information can be used to perform real-time blink detection. For each sensor, the data is saved to a separate CSV file.\r\n\r\n### Real-time Ground Truth Labeling\r\nAn integrated activity logging interface allows real-time ground truth labeling by the use of Google Glass' touchpad. Due to the way the activity logging interface was integrated into the sensor data logging software, it is possible to continuously label in a single sensor data recording process while performing several successive activities. Once the label is set, Google Glass' display is automatically turned off to avoid influencing the participant's behavior while executing the activity. \r\n\r\n> First, a categorical overview is shown to the user by Google Glass' display. The overview consists of three categories. A category can be selected by the number of fingers that are used.\r\n\r\n![ground truth labeling - category selection](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl1.png)\r\n\r\n> Based on the swipe direction, the user chooses a particular activity. An activity label contains the name of the activity as well as the activity's start timestamp. The respective activity label is simply logged through the act of selecting an activity. \r\n\r\n![ground truth labeling - activity selection](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl2.png)\r\n\r\n![ground truth labeling - activity selected](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl3.png)\r\n\r\n> After the activity has been performed, stop recording.\r\n\r\n![ground truth labeling - stop recording](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl4.png)\r\n\r\n## Possible Applications\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning - Activity Recognition\r\nThis software can be used in the area of activity recognition using a machine learning approach. It allows to record sensor data and to perform real-time ground truth labeling. \r\n\r\n> Here you can see the accelerometer ouput (z-axis) during the activities \"eating (a soup)\", \"walking\", and \"reading\".\r\n\r\n![Google Glass accelerometer (z-axis)](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/GoogleGlass_ACC_Z-Axis.png)\r\n\r\n> This picture shows the activity \"sawing\".\r\n\r\n![Person is sawing](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/sawing.png)\r\n\r\n### Internet of Things (Industrial and smart home applications)\r\nThe integrated beacon detection module allows the Google Glass to detect nearby devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Devices sending out a beacon signal will thus be identifiable through their identification number. Furthermore, the integrated module allows calculating the distance to the beacon. Based on this data, applications in the area of IoT can be realized.\r\n\r\n> This picture shows a coffee machine with a beacon on it. In future devices, such beacons or similar technology will be built-in.\r\n\r\n![Beacon on a coffee machine](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/beaconCoffeeMachine.jpg)\r\n\r\n> This picture shows a dishwasher machine with a beacon on it.\r\n\r\n![Beacon on a dishwasher](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/beaconDishwasher.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Blink Detection\r\nA module which allows one to read out Google Glass' infrared eye proximity sensor is integrated. The module integrated can be found here: [GlassLogger](https://github.com/shoya140/GlassLogger). This eye proximity sensor information can be used to perform real-time blink detection.\r\n\r\n_Hint: In order to read the infrared eye proximity sensor out, you need to do some extra steps during installation. Please have a look at the installation instructions here: [GlassLogger](https://github.com/shoya140/GlassLogger)_\r\n\r\n> Blinks of the right eye are counted.\r\n\r\n![Blinks](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/blinkDetection.png)\r\n",
