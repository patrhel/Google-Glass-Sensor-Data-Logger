It allows to record sensor data and to perform a real-time ground truth labeling \r\n\r\n![Google Glass on a table](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/GoogleGlass.png)\r\n\r\n## Functionality\r\n\r\n### Sensor Data logging\r\nThis software is able to record motion, orientation, visual, acoustic, and beacon proximity sensor data on the Google Glass. Furthermore, a module that allows one to read out Google Glass' infrared eye proximity sensor is integrated. This sensor information is used to perform real-time blink detection. For each sensor, the data is saved to a separate CSV file.\r\n\r\n### Real-time ground truth labeling\r\nAn integrated activity logging interface allows real-time ground truth labeling by the use of Google Glass' touchpad.\r\nFirst, a categorical overview is shown to the user by Google Glass' display. The respective activity label is simply logged through the act of selecting an activity. The overview consists of three categories. A category can be selected by the number of fingers that are used. Based on the swipe direction, the user chooses a particular activity. An activity label contains the name of the activity as well as the activity's start timestamp. Due to the way the activity logging interface was integrated into the sensor data logging software, it is possible to continuously label in a single sensor data recording process while performing several successive activities. Once the label is set, Google Glass' display is automatically turned off to avoid influencing the participant's behavior while executing the activity. \r\n\r\n![ground truth labeling - category selection](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl1.png)\r\n![ground truth labeling - activity selection](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl2.png)\r\n![ground truth labeling - activity selected](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl3.png)\r\n![ground truth labeling - stop recording](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/gtl4.png)\r\n\r\n## Possible Applications\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning - Activity Recognition\r\nThis software is used in the area of activity recognition using a supervised machine learning approach. It allows to record sensor data and to perform real-time ground truth labeling. \r\n\r\n![Google Glass accelerator (z-axis)](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/GoogleGlass_ACC_Z-Axis.png)\r\n![Person is sawing](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/sawing.png)\r\n\r\n### Internet of Things (Industrial and smart home applications)\r\nThe integrated beacon detection module allows the Google Glass to detect nearby devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. Devices sending out a beacon signal will thus be identifiable through their identification number. Furthermore, the integrated module allows calculating the distance to the beacon. Based on this data, applications in the area of IoT can be realized.\r\n\r\n![Beacon on a coffee machine](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/beaconCoffeeMachine.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Beacon on a dishwasher](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/beaconDishwasher.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Blink Detection\r\nA module which allows one to read out Google Glass' infrared eye proximity sensor is integrated. The module integrated can be found here: [GlassLogger](https://github.com/shoya140/GlassLogger). This sensor information can be used to perform real-time blink detection.\r\n\r\n_Hint: In order to read the infrared eye proximity sensor out you need to do some extra steps during installation. Please have a look at the installation instructions here: [GlassLogger](https://github.com/shoya140/GlassLogger)_\r\n\r\n![Blinks](https://github.com/patrhel/Google-Glass-Sensor-Data-Logger/raw/gh-pages/images/blinkDetection.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
